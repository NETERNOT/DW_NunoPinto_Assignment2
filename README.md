# Nuno Pinto Mock Portfolio
Second assignment of Web Development course of the Design and Multimedia masters, 2025/26

This project is a mock design portfolio, using vanilla HTML,CSS, and JS, to create a dynamic and interactive webpage. In this project, I used the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) to simulate images for fictional design projects.
